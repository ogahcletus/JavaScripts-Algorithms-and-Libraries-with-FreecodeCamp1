/* In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. 
JavaScript provides eight different data types which are: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
